### The goal

Practice website design by creating a restaurant website.

<!-- 
### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above. -->


### Links

- Live Site URL: https://amgallo1213.github.io/Marigold_Kitchen/
- 

## My process

My first step is to determine content for the site. After that, I break the content down into sections and decide on how to lay out the different sections. 


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap for React 


### What I learned

I learned how to make a photo carousel and worked on my design skills.


### Continued development

Things I wish to continue working on are design and layout of modern websites, including font styling, colors and spacing.


## Acknowledgments

I must credit the now-closed restaurant Marigold Kitchen and its chef Rob Halpern for the information used to fill in the website. I struggle with design because I need content to build around. Already having the info for Marigold sped up my design process and website creation.
